  Secondary System Description Table (SSDT) for hardware reduced events.

  Arm Reference Design platforms implement the HW-Reduced ACPI model and do not
  support legacy ACPI Fixed Hardware interfaces.

  GPIO Signalled ACPI event is one of the methods for signalling events in
  HW-Reduced ACPI model. In this method, ACPI events can be signaled when a GPIO
  Interrupt is received by OSPM and that GPIO Interrupt Connection is listed in
  a GPIO controller deviceâ€™s _AEI object.
